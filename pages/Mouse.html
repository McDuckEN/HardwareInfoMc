                    The mouse is one of the most important computer tools that you can use to perform the most important and common computer tasks. The computer mouse tool is one of the tools that the user can use to control the programs running on the computer.
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    In short : The computer mouse is one of the most widely used computer tools, with which you will perform most of the basic and common computer operations. Operations such as clicking.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Sensors are used to build a computer mouse so that the computer can detect mouse movement and clicks and recognize the information entered.

                <p>
                    This may be interesting for you to know that early computers did not have a mouse and the user met all his needs through the keyboard or keypad.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    With the advancement of technology, more advanced operating systems such as Windows and Macintosh entered the competition, and the keyboard alone could not meet the user's needs.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>                
                    The needs of computer users and the need for a tool for faster program input created the first spark for the invention of the computer mouse in the minds of engineers designing computer graphics operating systems. In this way, the first computer mouse was produced.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The main function of the mouse is to detect the direction in which the hand moves this device, as well as the speed of movement.

                    How a computer mouse works ?
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    You may be wondering how the mouse detects the direction and speed of movement and sends it to the computer? The mouse has very small cameras that take about 1500 pictures per second. In this way, it records the instantaneous position and hundredths of a second by hundredths of a second of the mouse. In this way, it can detect the speed and direction of movement every hundredth of a second.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The new generation of computer mice are laser mice, which are very useful for graphic software. The accuracy of mouse movement and movement in the new generation of laser mice is 10 times that of ordinary mice...
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    One of the important applications when the keyboard does not work is to use it as a virtual keyboard.
                </p>
