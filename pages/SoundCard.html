                    Most computers, tablets, and smartphones have built-in sound cards that convert digital signals into audio signals. However, these sound cards are not suitable for professional tasks such as recording and playing high-quality audio because there are limitations in the number of signals and channels available. Hence, you need an audio interface, which in simple terms is an upgraded sound card.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    A sound card allows you to record or play audio in multiple audio channels easily and without delay, and is essentially a converter for converting analog to digital audio and digital to analog audio. A sound card is a computer peripheral that is used to receive sound from inside and outside the computer. By peripheral, it means that your computer can meet your needs without a sound card, but if you need to mix and master music, create a home studio, record sound, and engineer it, you need to use a sound card.

                <p>
                    What is the function of a sound card ?
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Now that we know the answer to the question of what a sound card is, we will discuss what this valuable piece of hardware is going to do by installing a sound card on a computer. In this context, we should mention in very simple language that the main job of a sound card on a computer is to transmit sound.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>                
                    Audio sounds are actually analog-like signals that are emitted in the form of successive waves due to vibration from the sound source, and the computer is constantly processing these analog-like signals, and for this reason these signals have many changes.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The sound card prepares various audio signals for playback through speakers, processing incoming audio signals from microphones and other instruments, and for storage by the computer.
                </p>

                <br><br>
                <p>
                    Who needs to use a Sound Card ?
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Now we know what a sound card is and what it does. Now we are going to look at who needs a sound card. All computers are equipped with a sound card and allow you to connect your speakers or headphones to it.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In other words, the sound cards connected to the computer have a line level input and output, which are of quite ordinary quality, and an output for headphones. Since these sound cards have ordinary quality and electromagnetic signal disturbances, radio interference, as well as high delays in sound transmission can have a bad effect on the quality of the input and output sound, they are not suitable for professional use at all.
