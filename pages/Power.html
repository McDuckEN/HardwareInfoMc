                    A computer power supply is a piece of hardware that supplies power to an electrical device. It takes electricity from an electrical outlet and converts it from AC (alternating current) to DC (direct current), which is what the computer needs. It also regulates the voltage to a level that allows the computer to operate without overheating. The power supply is an integral part of any computer and must be working properly for the rest of the components to work.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In Short : A computer power supply is a piece of hardware that, as a power source, supplies the power needed by the electrical and electronic components inside the computer.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Computer components require direct current, but the current inside the outlet is alternating. As a result, one of the tasks of the power supply is to convert the alternating current of the city into the direct current required by the components.

                    What is the function of computer power ?
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    A power supply takes the electrical power it receives from input sources and then converts it into the format required by the computer. There are two main types of power supplies, which differ in the conversion. The most common type of power supply converts alternating current (AC) from the power supply to direct current (DC), which is called an AC-DC power supply. DC-DC power supplies are less common. They are often used to connect electrical devices to battery power sources, such as car sockets, or other sources that provide DC current. In general, most power supplies provide AC power.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>                
                    All the components in a computer case get their power from the power supply. For example, the motherboard, RAM, CPU, hard drive, disk drives, and most video cards (if the computer has one) all get power from the power supply. Any external devices and other peripherals, such as computer monitors and printers, have their own power supplies or, like some USB devices, get power from the data cable.
                </p>

                <br><br>
                <p>
                    The power supply is a very important piece of equipment because without it, the rest of the hardware inside can’t work. Motherboards, cases, and power supplies all come in different sizes, called form factors. All three must be compatible in order to work together properly.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    CoolMax, CORSAIR, and Ultra are the most popular power supply manufacturers, but most of them come with the purchase of the computer, so you only deal with the manufacturer when you replace the PSU.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The back of the computer power supply has a male and three-prong port that a power cable connected to the power supply plugs into. There is also often a power switch and a voltage switch on the power supply.
