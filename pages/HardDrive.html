                    A hard disk or hard drive is a storage device used to store data processed by a computer. The operating system, software, and related files are all stored on the hard disk. A hard disk drive is also known as a fixed disk drive, fixed disk, fixed drive, hard disk, and hard drive. The word hard or hard that we use for a hard disk or hard disk is because a hard disk is a mechanical storage device because it has several disks and includes platters and other components.

                <p>                
                    Sometimes SSDs are mistakenly called SSD hard drives, which is completely wrong because unlike hard drives, SSDs do not have mechanical parts. It should be noted that SSDs stand for Solid State Drive or Solid State Disk. It can also be called Soft State Drive, which is completely misleading. D: In operating systems like Windows, when you first install Windows, a drive or partition called C is created, which is also referred to as the Primary Partition or the main partition. Famous companies that manufacture hard drives include Hitachi, Western Digital, and Seagate.

                    How does a hard drive work ?
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Unlike volatile memory like RAM, a hard drive retains its data even when the power is turned off. That's why you can restart your computer and still access all the data even if the HDD loses power when the power is turned on again.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Inside a hard drive, there are sectors that are arranged on tracks that store data on rotating platters. The data stored on the platters is read and written by a magnetic head that is moved back and forth by an actuator arm.

                    Types of hard drives :
                </p>

                <p>
                    A computer hard drive is not the only type of hard drive, and SATA and PATA are not the only ways they connect to a computer. One thing that varies greatly among hard drives is their size. Some are very small, while others are much larger. For example, a standard flash drive also has a hard drive. But like a traditional hard drive, it doesn't spin. Sometimes, a flash drive is called a solid-state drive (SSD), which connects to a computer via USB. There are also hybrid models known as SSHDs.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Another type of USB hard drive is an external hard drive. This is the same as a regular hard drive, but for added security, it is housed in a special enclosure for being outside the computer. These hard drives usually connect to the computer via a USB interface. But some also use FireWire or eSATA.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                   
Inside an external enclosure, an internal hard drive is housed. If you want to turn your internal hard drive into an external hard drive, you can use an enclosure. These enclosures also connect to your computer using USB, FireWire, or ESATA.
