                    A monitor is a display device, such as a television screen, that interprets and displays the graphics output signal from the computer's graphics card. It allows you to use the display interface to interact with your computer and use peripherals such as a mouse or keyboard. You can see the desired result on the screen by moving the mouse. You can also see the commands you issue with the keyboard through the monitor.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In short, it is a display and output device and one of the computer equipment on which the image produced by the computer's video adapter is displayed. The display is connected to the video adapter by a cable.

                  History of the monitor : 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The monitor has a long and interesting history, starting with the invention of the first computer in 1936 by Konrad Zuse. But William Crookes was the first person to invent a monitor in 1878, a device used to display information.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>                
                    Over time, monitors gradually found uses beyond displaying information, and various changes and innovations were implemented in them.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In the 1950s, the teletypewriter was invented, which allowed data to be sent and communication between computers. This invention was a very important turning point in the design and use of monitors for computers.

                <p>
                    In the 1970s, the CRT monitor was created, which was considered the first color monitor. This monitor, which allowed for the first time to see color and clearer images, was the beginning of the creation of modern monitors.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Since then, significant advances have been made in monitors and related technologies, including computer cases, and today, monitors from major companies such as LG monitors, BenQ monitors, Samsung, ASUS, etc. have significant features. Today's LCD and LED monitors have much higher resolutions and much more vibrant and beautiful colors, and touch monitors also create a more interactive experience.
