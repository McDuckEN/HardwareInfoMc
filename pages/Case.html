                <p>
                    Case literally means "frame" and "box"; as a result, the general meaning of a case in electronic devices is a container that houses the internal components of that device.<br><br>
                    For example, the physical body of mobile phones, laptops, and tablets is also practically considered their case, because according to the literal meaning of this word, the physical body of these devices is a box to hold their internal components.<br><br>
                    However, when we say "computer case" we are actually talking about the case of a traditional desktop computer. This case is actually the most important component of your computer and its core, and if your system has a problem, you should look for a solution inside the case !

                    Some well-known companies that manufacture computer cases are Xoxide, NZXT, and Antec, which may also call the computer case by other names; For example, "box," "system unit," "enclosure," and "chassis" are some of the additional names for computer cases that are commonly used by professionals and case manufacturing companies.

                <p>
                    One of the most important components of a computer is the computer case: a metal or plastic enclosure that is the core of a computer system.

                <br>
                <p>                
                    All the internal components of a computer that are necessary for its proper functioning, including the motherboard, hard drive, various drives, etc., are housed in the case. In fact, all operations performed by the computer are managed by the case.

                    Regardless of the company or system it is made for, a computer case has some fixed and unchangeable characteristics that form the core of a computer case. In this section, we will introduce you to some of the characteristics of a computer case.

                    However, each person can order his computer case from computer equipment manufacturing and distribution centers and add the features he wants to it, depending on his taste. Usually, people change the appearance of the case; they add more colored LEDs to it and paint its body. But there are also people who, depending on the performance of their computer, replace and move some parts inside the case.
