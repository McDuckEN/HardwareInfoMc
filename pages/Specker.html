                    Loudspeakers are devices that convert electrical signals amplified by an amplifier into air vibrations that can be heard by humans as sound. Loudspeakers come in many shapes and sizes, types, and models. Regardless of their design, the purpose of speakers is to produce an audio output that can be heard by humans or listeners.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Loudspeakers receive audio input from a device, such as a computer or audio receiver. This input may be analog or digital. Analog speakers translate analog electromagnetic waves into sound waves. Since sound waves are produced in analog form, digital speakers must first convert the digital input into an analog signal and then produce the sound waves. The sound produced by loudspeakers is defined by frequency and amplitude. Frequency determines how high or low the pitch of a sound is.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    For example, a soprano singer's voice produces high-frequency sound waves, while a bass guitar or drum beat produces sounds in the low-frequency range. The ability of a speaker system to accurately reproduce audio frequencies can be a good indicator of how clean (without noise) the sound will be. Many speakers include different speaker cones for different frequency ranges, which helps produce more accurate sounds for each range.

                <p>
                    Two-way speakers typically have a tweeter and a midrange speaker, while three-way speakers have a midrange speaker, tweeter, and subwoofer. The range, or loudness, of a sound is determined by the change in air pressure created by the speaker's sound waves. So, when you turn up your speakers, you are actually increasing the air pressure of the sound waves.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>                
                    Since the signal produced by some sound sources is not very high (such as a computer sound card), it may need to be amplified by the speaker. Therefore, most external computer speakers are amplified, meaning they use electricity to amplify the signal. Speakers that can amplify the sound input are often active speakers
                </p>
                <br>

                <br><br>
                <p>
                    You can usually tell a speaker is active if it has a volume control or can be plugged into a power source. Speakers that do not have any internal amplification are called passive speakers. Since these speakers do not amplify the audio signal, they require a high level of audio input, which may be generated by an audio amplifier.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Speakers are usually divided into two groups, which allows them to produce stereo sound. This means that the left and right speakers transmit sound in two completely separate channels. Using two speakers makes the sound sound more natural. Surround systems may include four to seven speakers (plus a subwoofer), which creates a more realistic experience.
